  <p class="text">My name is Herbert McKoy. I am the CEO & Web Developer for VET -aka- (Virtual Entertainment Television).
        
        
  My background is in Law Enforcement. I never thought I would not be working as anything other than the Police. My career was everything to me, but over time, I had surcumb to illness. Due to my health, I was forced retire. Shortly afterwards, I was placed on dialysis. Unlike most dialysis patients, I had to undergo my dialysis treatments, 6 to 7 days a week. This was my life for 5 long years as I waited and waited for a kidney transpant. During my years of dialysis treatments, I've had many surgeries over the years. Procedures on my veins, catheters removed only to later be replaced, multiple fistulas, and open ‚ù§ surgeries. Yet, here I am a survivor. On December 31st, 2020 New Years Eve, I finally received the kidney transplant that I fought so hard to receive.
        
  I'm telling you this story to give you an example of the Fight that dwells within me. I'm the warrior who has fought to live, learn, and survive. I have the WILL to fight for myself but I will also fight for you. 
        
  During dialysis treatments, I used the time to prepare for a new career. I have learned skills in Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Game Design with Unity, Open CV w/Object Detection, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and complete Full-Stack Javascript Development. I can learn and adapt to most platforms and programming languages. I learn what's necessary to get the job done.
        
  Being a musician since 8 years old, I have always had the love for creating something from a basic idea. I enjoy deconstruction and reconstructioning to bring to life a dream into reality. My joy comes from helping others as they become successful. Intangibles cannot be taught in a classroom. No, it is taught exclusively in the school of the "Hard Knocks" and I have graduated with a Ph.D. So, if you are looking for a determined problem solver, thinker, innovative creator, and someone who just appreciates the life he has been given.... go to the contact page.
