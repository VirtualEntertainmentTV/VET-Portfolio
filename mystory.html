        I've spent the last 5 years on dialysis, before receiving a kidney transplant on New Years Eve, 2020. During dialysis treatments, I used that time to learn. I've learned skills in Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Game Design, OpenCV w/Object Detection, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and complete Full-Stack Javascript Development. I can learn and adapt to most platforms and programming languages. I learn what's necessary to get the job done. My joy comes from helping others as they become successful. Intangibles are not taught in a classroom. No, it is taught exclusively in the school of the
        "Hard Knocks" and I have graduated with a Ph.D. So, if you are looking for a determined problem solver, thinker, innovative creator, and someone who just appreciates the second life that he has been given.... go to the contact page. Send me a message. Let's connect!
